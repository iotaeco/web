            <h3>IOTA Ecosystem Development Fund Grant/Donation Tracker</h3>
            <p>I was approached by the IOTA Foundation (IF) to develop the IOTA Ecosystem Grant/Donation Tracker
                <a href="https://transparency.iota.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://transparency.iota.org/</a>
            </p>

            <p>The essence of the tracker was to be able to provide a completely transparent and auditable view of the greenlit
                grants and donations received by the IOTA Ecosystem Development Fund. This data could have been stored in
                a regular database but given that the tracker is for IF it makes sense to utilise their own technology, the
                Tangle.
            </p>

            <p>An article describing the process taken for the storage element is available on
                <a href="https://medium.com/@iota.eco/iota-ecosytem-fund-tracker-storage-dd8c90b7c4ea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a>.
            </p>

            <p>A simplified version of the implementation is available on
                <a href="https://github.com/iotaeco/iota-database-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>.

            <h3>IOTA Pico Framework</h3>
            <p>The IOTA Pico Framework is intended to be a multi-layered set of object oriented JavaScript libraries.</p>

            <p>Each layer is fully abstracted allowing you to replace components with your own implementations very easily.</p>

            <p>The libraries are written in TypeScript so are all strongly typed. The modules are generated as ES6 so you
                may need to transpile them when including them for use in older JavaScript eco-systems. The code will run
                without transpilation in all modern browsers and when used by NodeJs.</p>

                <a href="./assets/iota-pico-examples-browser-js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, this should run
                in all modern browsers.</p>

                The aim of UniteJS is to provide a CLI tool which you can use to create a ready to roll application with code, styling, unit
                tests and e2e tests and zero configuration. All combinations of the chosen technologies provide the same
